By default, MarsCode provides you with a default running configuration. If you need to modify it, you can do so in the `.vscode/launch.json` file. Refer to [Visual Studio Code's documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) for more information on how to configure `launch.json`.
